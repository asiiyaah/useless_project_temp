### Project Description
BananAlyzer is a fun web app where you upload a banana photo, and the site detects whether it‚Äôs peeled from the top or bottom. Before you can view the results, you must play a quick game , align the tip of the falling banana with the peel at the bottom to win and unlock your analysis.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Humanity has long struggled with one critical, unasked question ‚Äî ‚ÄúWhich side of the banana did you just peel? Was it the top or the bottom?‚Äù

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Banan-Alyzer uses cutting-edge ‚Äúbanana orientation detection‚Äù technology to determine whether your banana photo understand whether your banana was peeled in the right way. But we don‚Äôt just hand you the answer ‚Äî you must first prove your worth by playing a silly banana-catching game. Only then shall the sacred banana truth be revealed.
